Basic Blogging Platform with Node.js
====================================

Challenge Description:
----------------------

Welcome to this beginner-level challenge that aims to help you understand the basic operations of Node.js and Express.js, including creating APIs, connecting to databases, and managing CRUD operations. In the latter part of the project, we will also guide you through migrating your database from MongoDB to PostgreSQL using Prisma.

Prerequisites:
--------------

-   A basic understanding of JavaScript.
-   Node.js and npm installed in your system.
-   MongoDB installed in your system or MongoDB Atlas account.
-   PostgreSQL installed in your system or a PostgreSQL cloud database account.
-   Prisma installed in your system.

Learning Objectives:
--------------------

1.  Learn how to create a server using Node.js and Express.js.
2.  Understand how to connect to MongoDB and manage CRUD operations.
3.  Learn to define schemas and models using mongoose.
4.  Learn how to migrate a MongoDB database to PostgreSQL using Prisma.
5.  Gain a basic understanding of using Prisma with PostgreSQL for CRUD operations.

Challenge Steps:
----------------

1.  Setup Your Project: Initialize a new Node.js project and install necessary packages: express, mongoose, and body-parser.
2.  Create a Server: Write a basic server setup with Express.js.
3.  Connect to MongoDB: Using mongoose, connect your application to MongoDB.
4.  Create a Blog Schema: Define a blog schema for your blog posts.
5.  Implement CRUD operations: Create routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.
6.  Setup Prisma: Install Prisma and setup the necessary Prisma configurations for PostgreSQL.
7.  Migrate Database: Migrate your existing MongoDB database to PostgreSQL using Prisma.
8.  Refactor CRUD operations: Update your CRUD operations to use Prisma and PostgreSQL instead of mongoose and MongoDB.

By the end of this challenge, you'll have a basic blogging platform powered by Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL (via Prisma), having migrated it from MongoDB. This is an excellent starting point to further expand your application by adding features such as user authentication, comments on blog posts, etc. Happy coding!


1\. User Authentication:
------------------------

Implement a user authentication system where users can register, log in, and log out. You can use libraries like Passport.js or bcrypt.js for password hashing and Express-session or JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.

2\. User Roles and Authorizations:
----------------------------------

Not all users of the system have the same abilities. For instance, you could have admins who can delete any post, and standard users who can only delete their posts. Adding different roles and permissions can make the project more complex and realistic.

3\. Comment System:
-------------------

Allow users to add comments to a blog post. This will require a new Comment model and associated CRUD operations. Consider how you want to handle comment moderation or replies to comments as well.

4\. Pagination:
---------------

When the number of blog posts grows, fetching all of them at once isn't practical. Implement pagination to limit the number of posts retrieved at once and allow users to browse through different 'pages' of content.

5\. Search Functionality:
-------------------------

Enable users to search blog posts by title or content. This will require you to create a new route and corresponding database query.

6\. Post Categories or Tags:
----------------------------

Allow each post to be associated with one or more categories or tags, and let users view all posts associated with a given category or tag.

7\. Image Uploads:
------------------

Let users upload images as part of their blog posts. This can be somewhat challenging as you'll need to handle file uploads and possibly integrate with a cloud storage service like Amazon S3.

8\. Post Likes/Claps:
---------------------

Implement a feature to let users 'like' or 'clap for' posts, similar to Medium. This will require a way to keep track of how many likes each post has received and possibly who has liked it.

9\. User Profiles:
------------------

Create a user profile page where users can see their information, their posts, and maybe even their comments or likes.

10\. Post Drafts:
-----------------

Let users save drafts of their posts so they can come back and finish writing later. Users should be able to see a list of all their draft posts, and publish a draft when they're ready.

Adding these features would not only make your blogging platform more realistic, but also allow you to practice and learn different aspects of web development!
